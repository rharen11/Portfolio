                Hi, I’m Rachel- a Virginia transplant living the Californian dream. My time in college was both challenging and diverse at VCU and Shenandoah University where I earned my PharmD. My professional journey started as a pharmacy technician and worked myself up to a clinical pharmacist. For the past several years I’ve dedicated my time to grabbing any acute care experience I can and working on becoming an efficient and integral part of the medical team. 
                The past few years changed, though. COVID hit and the healthcare arena changed. The pandemic challenged every skillset I had and sharpened it during my time working nights at our community hospital here in Sonoma County. That’s when I discovered the power of technology. I depend on our software to work every single time. Patient care depended on it. With this, my interest in software engineering was born. I wanted to fix things. Improve workflow. Provide better systems for providers. This all trickles down to better care for my community.
                The healthcare infrastructure has been tested, and in a lot of ways, failed. My vision is to build better workflows for providers through software development. Supporting our healthcare workers will improve quality of life for Americans and give way to easier access to care for those living in underserved areas. “It is only when they go wrong that machines remind you how powerful they are.” -Clive James
